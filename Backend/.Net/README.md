## C# and .NET

.NET is a free, open-source, general purpose development platform for building modern cloud-based applications on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS\
.NET is built on a high-performance runtime that is used in production by many high-scale apps.

C# on the other hand is a general-purpose, type-safe, object-oriented programming language that runs on .NET

It can be confusing to see .Net Core, .Net Framework, and .Net Standard thrown around in various documentation\
[Here's a link that tries to demestify the differences](https://code-maze.com/differences-between-net-framework-net-core-and-net-standard 'Differences between .NET, .NET Framework and .NET Standard').

Assuming that you do get through that whole word-fest, you can jump right into it and start building your first .NET app.
